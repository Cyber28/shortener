# Shortener
This is just a simple URL shortener written in 2 hours for fun.

# Should I use this?
No, absolutely not! It's missing a lot of things such as:
- an endpoint to delete links
- link validation
- proper security

# Why don't you clean up the repo?
I'm lazy and this project is meaningless. If you want to do it, feel free to open a PR.
